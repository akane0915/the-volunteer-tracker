## Description

This application is intended for a company or organization to use internally.  Its purpose is to allow an employee (most likely an employee who oversees all projects for the company), to track projects and volunteers working on each project.  The application can store multiple projects and multiple volunteers, but each volunteer can only work on one project at a time (one-to-many) relationship.

The application contains two database tables: volunteers and projects. The homepage of the application lists all projects and includes a form to add a project.  When a project is clicked, it leads to a page with the project's volunteers.  Users are able to update and delete a project or a user after they have been created via CRUD functionality.  This applications also uses RESTFUL routing.
